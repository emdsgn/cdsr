  <dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>Robotic interventions have recently been proposed to replace manual operations of continuum systems such as catheters and endoscopes. Many of such operations are lengthy and often depend on fluoroscopy (X-ray) for guiding the device. The occupational hazards in medical interventions are serious. The advantages of robotic operations include releasing the interventionists from exposure to hazardous radiation, improving ergonomic factors, integrating the precision of robots into operations, less dependency on the operator’s skills, and possibility for multi-tasking. The primary focus of this talk will be on robotic cardiovascular catheterization in which two or more catheters are operated from a distance. Despite promising aspects of robotic catheterization, many modeling, sensing and control issues remain to be addressed. In addition to the characteristic issues of catheters (such as severe nonlinearities, coupled mechanics, under-actuation, low stiffness and dexterity), their operation in confined spaces also imposes major constraints on sensing and servo feedback.<br>
  This presentation will provide an overview of recent advances on robotic cardiac catheterization. First, non-conventional modeling approaches for catheters will be reviewed. Next, novel sensing and estimation techniques, and servo control structures for semi-autonomous catheterization will be presented. Finally future directions of research will be outlined. The results of this research can potentially be used to enable manipulating soft longitudinal structures in different scales, opening the door to new frontier in many disciplines such as biology, medicine, material science, and manufacturing</dd>

  <dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>Modern aircraft design has seen increases in aspect-ratio of wings and uses of composite materials to reduce airframe weight, which contribute to higher aerodynamic efficiency, less fuel consumption and thus longer endurance. It is often developed for high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) flight applications. While benefiting from such design, new challenges arise as these improvements also give rise to more structural flexibility in aircraft wings. The interaction between rigid-body dynamics, structural dynamics and aerodynamics may become strong enough to produce undesirable aero-elastic effects. Therefore, it is important to take into account the significant aero-elastic modes in modeling and control design for flexible aircraft more than ever when traditional aircraft may only have very limited aero-elastic effects. In this talk, recent research work will be highlighted in this area, focusing on a uniform dynamics modeling platform, an integrated control design that is capable of both rigid-body motion control and aero-elastic mode suppression. Further, this talk will present the latest work of addressing gust alleviation, as well as fault-tolerant design in the presence of faulted control surfaces as well as actuator/sensor failures. In addition, research work of formation flight of UAVs will be presented with successful field flight demonstrations.</dd>

          <dd>Automated quality control inspection is essential in manufacturing industries in these days. The purpose of this study is to improve product quality as well as increasing productivity by integrating three crucial systems in manufacturing lines; a robotic arm, 2D-vision, and conveyor system. As most of integrated systems have a tricky setup process to connect them to work as a single fully automated system, the process is a challenging, important step; for example, to connect a robot arm with 2D-vision based robotic inspection, and conveyor system controlled by a PLC, communicating with each other via communication network (Ethernet, Modbus). To determine main factors among selected characteristics, Minitab software is applied especially, to analyse 2D-vision system’s ability and identify defective products while developing the entire process. A letter “O” was assigned as a testbed to simulate five defective workpieces: abrasion, chip, pitting, extra-material, and warp defect types, along with a template workpiece attached on Mock Bottle Cap. After two vision analyses using Minitab are applied to the integrated system, the result of 2D-vision inspection system is then able to identify four of the five simulated defects and the template workpiece, but not the warp defect due to the vision software with hardware. The vision inspection rate is over 95% successful among the identified defects. Analysis of experimental data has been developed to find highly accurate relationship between conveyor motor speed (RPM) and the time interval to pick up defects by the robotic system for real-world applications with the help of Minitab software and tools of statistical analyses. Therefore, the research demonstrates that an integrated three-subsystem could have huge potential and promising in the future if we are able keep improving each subsystem while testing with a variety of different letters or shapes, to enhance manufacturing production line to increase quality control and quality assurance.</dd>

          <dd>Currently, we realize a two-hand playing piano robot which can recognize printed piano score in real time and then play piano by itself. The playing piano robot is composed of two subsystems: a vision system and a two-hand playing system. In this paper, we focus on presenting the two-hand playing system that consists of a finger system and an arm system for each hand. For the finger system, we design a simple signal control module which can receive a signal from the host computer and drive an exact tubular solenoid after the signal is decoded. The arm system is driven by two linear motors, each of which carries a hand to run a different gamut by sliding from left to right or vice versa. In addition, because the sliding ranges of these two linear motors are overlapped, we create a collision avoidance mechanism to ensure their motions are safe and sound. The experimental results reveal that the two-hand playing system can play theme and accompaniment simultaneously which has the ability of playing chords. The safe speed of playing must be smaller than tempo 100. So far, the two-hand playing system works smoothly and undeniably.</dd>

          <dd>Sina is a robotic telesurgery system that accepts and works with conventional laparoscopic tools at its endeffector. This paper describes the design and analysis of an adapting mechanism for Sina, to enable the system manipulating a manual wristed laparoscopic instrument, i.e., Laparo-Angle. At first, the kinematics and dynamics characteristics of Laparo-Angle were identified experimentally. Then, the design considerations of the activation mechanism, including compatibility with the instrument (at one side) and the host robotic arm (at the other side), kinematics and dynamics features, ease of tool replacement, etc., were studied and a conceptual design, based on the Agile Eye mechanism, was proposed. The forward and inverse kinematics analysis of the proposed mechanism revealed that it is capable of providing the desired workspace while meeting the design constraints. The workspace of the mechanism was a cone with an apex angle of 35 degrees, in which both the isotropy and manipulability indices were satisfying. The condition number and the Jacobean determinant of the mechanism within its workspace were lower than 1.4 and higher than 1, respectively. In general, the proposed mechanism was found to could satisfy the design requirements and constrains.</dd>

           <dt>Abstract</dt>
          <dd>This paper presents modelling, control and simulation results of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with only one fixed motor spinning a tilted propeller called “Monospinner”. This class of rotary-wing UAVs is gaining some significant attention since they can lead to the design and development of control strategies for safe landing in case of one single or multiple rotor failure. Furthermore, the studies on monospinners can lead to the development of the most energy-efficient rotary wing UAVs with a potential to render themselves as high-endurance flying machines. In a monospinner, unlike most flying vehicles with rotary wings, hovering is defined as maintaining the altitude while rotating about an axis that is fixed with respect to the vehicle. Therefore, not all degrees of motion can be fully controlled. However, the remaining controllable states of the machine will be good enough to maintain a stable altitude, or even to track a trajectory. For this purpose, a linear time-invariant system is derived for controlling the attitude. It is shown that by controlling the attitude, the direction of that fixed axis of rotation (i.e., a precession axis) can be controlled by which the altitude of the vehicle can be kept at constant. A complete aerodynamic model of the propeller experiencing fast rotations about the precession axis is presented for the first time followed by analysing the effect a tilting rotor can have on the total power required to maintain a constant altitude. The proposed dynamic model and the design were evaluated via a nonlinear simulation system. </dd>

          <dd>This paper presents a finite element model of a flexible cable that has been constructed to accurately model dynamic wrap angles around a static pulley. The study considers a system with a rope running over a pulley and a suspended load on one end moving in a circular arc. The model utilizes the Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation to define the generalized coordinates, chosen for its accurate definitions of large non-linear cable deformations. The interaction of the cable with the surface of a pulley is modeled using a contact penalty formulation. An experimental study is performed to analyze the performance of the model outputs: cable tension and wrap angle. During the testing the wrap angle had peak-to-peak oscillations of up to 122 degrees. The numerical simulation shows reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements. </dd>

          <dd>In this paper, a Pareto optimal strategy for uncertain Markovian linear stochastic system with multiple decision makers is investigated. By applying the guaranteed cost control principle, a set of conditions, wherein the stochastic system is exponentially mean-square stable (EMSS) and has a cost bound, is obtained using the stochastic algebraic Riccati inequality (SARI). In addition, the minimization problem of the cost bound is formulated. It is shown that the necessary conditions can be derived by a set of cross-coupled stochastic Riccati equations (CCSAREs). </dd>

          <dd>In this paper, an adaptive robust dynamic surface control strategy was proposed to improve the tracking performance of electro-hydraulic system (EHS) with unknown nonlinear disturbance and uncertain parameters. The dynamic surface control (DSC) technique was utilized to avoid the inherent “explosion of complexity” problem of the traditional back-stepping technique. The proposed control method could not only simplify the design process of the robust controller, but also estimate the uncertain parameters in combination with discontinuous projection operator. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, all signals of the closed-loop system were certified to be bounded, and semi-global asymptotic stability of the system was obtained. The simulation results verified that the control strategy is of anti-interference, and can enhance the trajectory tracking accuracy of the electro-hydraulic trajectory tracking system.</dd>

           <dt>Abstract</dt>
          <dd>We have recently presented a competitive method to solve overdetermined linear systems of equations with multiple right hand side vectors, where the unknown matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The coefficient and the right hand side matrices are respectively named as data and target matrices. There are also physical contexts, such as modeling a deformable structure and computing the correlation matrix in finance or insurance/reinsurance industries, where a symmetric positive semi-definite solution of an overdetermined linear system of equations needs to be computed. Several methods have been proposed for solving such problems with the assumption that the data matrix is unrealistically error free. In real measurements, however, both the data and target matrices may contain error. Thus, for practical purposes, an error in variables model appears to be more appropriate. Here, we define a new error function to consider error in both data and target matrices and propose an iterative algorithm to minimize the defined error. We illustrate that our proposed approach turns to be efficient in attaining accurate solutions. For this purpose, we generate random test problems and show that our proposed algorithm computes the solution faster than the existing methods. Moreover, the standard deviation in error matrix is considerably lower when we use our proposed algorithm. This feature makes our method more efficient and desirable in real applications.</dd>

          <dd>Time-frequency representations of signals are very important analysis tools which are required in various fields  of science and engineering. Observations of most dynamic systems provide non-stationary signals where frequency properties vary in time. There are vast amounts of studies on the development of new time-frequency representations in the literature. Some methods provide better resolutions in time or frequency, or some providing improvements on both resolutions but with the cost of complexity and observation of cross-terms. Currently all methods provide somewhat balanced solutions when compared to their trade-off observables; computation cost, complexity, and performances. Further,their performances are greatly limited by the Heisenberg-Gabor limit. In this work, three-dimensional time-frequency distribution (3D-TFD), three dimensional short-time Fourier transform (3D-STFT) are proposed, and the resolution improvement metric vector is defined. They are used to fuse the independent measurements of high resolution time and frequency. A heuristic practical approach is proposed as a proof-of-concept, and tested on a short duration pulse of constant frequency. It is observed that only two layers of 3D-STFT could be sufficient to obtain both high time and high frequency resolutions. Higher resolutions in both axes are obtained simultaneously. This novel method can be used in feature extraction, detection and other analysis applications. A more detailed study is planned as a future work.</dd>

           <dt>Abstract</dt>
          <dd>In this paper, a model-free sliding mode control system for linear and nonlinear uncertain multi-input multi-output systems is proposed. The developed method does not require a mathematical model of the dynamic system. Instead, the controller relies on state measurements and estimates of the error between previous and current control inputs to stabilize the system. Knowledge of the system’s order, shape of the control input matrix, and control gain bounds, if non-unitary, are the only variables assumed to develop the control law. Lyapunov’s stability criterion is used in the derivation process to ensure closed-loop asymptotic stability. High frequency chattering, often observed with the sliding mode control method, is eliminated using a smoothing boundary layer. Simulations are performed on a nonlinear two mass-spring-damper system and a quadrotor model to examine the performance of the proposed control law.</dd>

  <dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>In the Motion Research Group at the University of Waterloo, we investigate the dynamics, model-based control, and design optimization of multibody biomechatronic systems. Deriving the equations for these complex systems is both tedious and error-prone, so we have automated the dynamic modelling process by combining linear graph theory from mathematics with fundamental principles from physics and biology. Our symbolic computer implementation of this approach, now part of MapleSim™, will generate real-time simulation code and dynamic controllers for systems ranging from biomechatronic devices to autonomous vehicles. In this talk, I will discuss some advantages of a symbolic graph-theoretic approach to systems modelling and control, and highlight these advantages through a large number of real-world applications that include a plug-in Prius for Toyota, a rover for the Canadian Space Agency, a hockey slapshot robot, and a stroke rehabilitation robot that uses an integrated model of the patient’s musculoskeletal system and robot to determine optimal control actions. Both modelling and experimental results will be presented to show the real-world performance of the model-based designs and controllers. Future applications to autonomous vehicles and biomechatronic assistive devices will be discussed.</dd>

  <dd>I have no idea. But, for the last several years, we have been working on a vision-only, route-following technique for mobile robots, called Visual Teach & Repeat (VT&R). This approach is successful in practice because it (i) exploits human experience in route definition, (ii) avoids the need to build a global map of the world, and (iii) plays to the strengths of computer vision by keeping the viewpoints the same between teach and repeat. However, to scale up to real-world operations, we need to be able to repeat routes as quickly as possible, in the presence of dynamic obstacles, and of course deal with visual change (lighting, weather, etc.). In this talk, I will describe our latest approach, VT&R 2.0, that leverages past route-driving experience not only to improve visual localization (through Multi-Experience Localization), but also to improve our ability to detect obstacles visually in difficult scenarios (e.g., tall grass), and even track paths more accurately and more quickly over time. I will present field test results using our 1000 kg Grizzly mobile robot in a variety of outdoor, offroad scenarios. There will be lots of videos.</dd>

          <dd>Fractional PIλDμ controllers are considered as a promising alternative of PID controllers for future industrial applications. In comparison to classical PI and PID controllers, improved performance of fractional controllers for a number of applications has been reported. However, it is still unclear for which type of systems the more computationally-demanding fractional controllers would be significantly better as a replacement for integer PI and PID controllers. In this investigation, fractional controllers and classical PI and PID controllers have been tested for different benchmark systems to determine which classes of systems would benefit the most of using a more complex control algorithm. Results show that, despite the added degrees of freedom, it is not always beneficial to use such a computationally expensive controller and, only for some types of systems, fractional controllers will enhance controller performances.</dd>

          <dd>This paper investigates the use of convolutional neural networks for the purpose of image foreground extraction from a dynamic environment. The proposed solution utilises the latest developments in image segmentation using pixel-wise classification to produce foreground target extraction for real-time operations. A collection of spacecraft images were assembled for network training and evaluation. The proposed technique takes advantage of transfer learning for the stable training of a convolutional neural network classifier. The image extraction software was applied to a thermal camera video, taken by an undocking spacecraft from the International Space Station. The results show the proposed deep learning-based image extraction has advantages over traditional background subtraction methods. This investigation provides evidence that semantic segmentation using convolutional neural network can be an effective tool for spacecraft image isolation and extraction from a dynamically cluttered scene. </dd>

          <dd>Micro-cantilevers are micromechanical structures that are being used in detection and sensing as MEMS. The easy usage and the relatively simple fabrication of micro-cantilever beams make them stand as suitable candidates for a wide variety of engineering applications. Dynamic capability of micro-cantilever beams to withstand considerable impacts and even various static loadings make them useful in applications as AFM, inertial sensors, or flow applications. Specific configurations with micro cantilever beams could be used for more advanced applications such as liquid viscosity measurement. The main objective of this research is to investigate the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of two parallel micro cantilever beams with slightly different geometry under the condition of closed to pull-in voltage. The governing differential equations that model closely the dynamical behaviour micro-cantilever beams under electrostatic field are used in the formulation. The model is based on discreet 2 degree of freedom mass-spring-damping. The electrostatic loading induces the dynamical behaviour of two parallel micro cantilever beams expressed in two differential equations that are nonlinear and stiff. A specific algorithm that optimizes the integration steps which is named ISODE is used to perform the computation. The time response and phase diagram to the step-voltage for the mass-spring-damper system is derived numerically and the pull-in voltage of the system is evaluated.</dd>

          <dd>This paper describes an efficient guidance method for a space rover in an unknown and GPS-denied environment. In an unknown planet, it is effective for an exploration to use a method called FastSLAM that performs simultaneously localization and mapping using combination of a particle filter and extended Kalman filter. On the other hand, a guidance low based on the potential function method has been used because it does not require path planning in advance and is enable to respond to the sudden topographic change. However, using these methods, local minima problem in the potential field is frequently occurred when designing repulsive potential functions so as to avoid landmarks. The great advantage of the proposed method is that it is simple to escape local minima by using a repulsive particle, which is designed by using particles in a particle filter.  Experiments are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. </dd>

Large step response, step-train response and sinusoidal response are presented to show the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate 100 micrometer stroke with 1 micrometer resolution. Moreover, this micro-positioner is capable of tracking sinusoidal motion.

          <dd>Over the last two decades, satellites are getting smaller with increasing capabilities for space research. Small satellites (between 1 and 15 kg) show great promise as a low-cost option both in production and launching. In this work, attitude control problem for a cubesat is examined. A physical testbed is designed for simulation and testing in a single axis. Cubesat reaction wheel and the testbed are integrated, and fuzzy logic control software in Arduino Mega microprocessor environment is developed. The cubesat floor at the same axis of reaction wheel is tested and real-time measurement data are obtained. Step response and ramp response behaviours are analysed.</dd>

          <dd>The novel Atlas motion platform is designed to prescribe in six degrees of freedom the motion of a spherical simulator cockpit with the unusual capability of providing kinematically-uncoupled translational and rotational motion, unbounded rotational motion, and a fully-dexterous workspace. In support of the design and operation of the Atlas simulator, a translational dynamic model of the system has been developed. It includes the prescribed motion of the interface between the translational and rotational stages, translational motion of the spherical cockpit, and translational motion of the upper ‘halo’ support structure. Contact points between the spherical cockpit and the constraint/actuation system were modelled using directed elements consisting of either constant-force elements or spring/damper elements. In the case of the spring/damper elements, stiffness and damping parameters were obtained by a combination of finite element analysis of structural elements and experimental characterization of viscoelastic elements along the interfacing load paths. The dynamic model is suitable for evaluating internal forces and relative motions within the simulator resulting from translation motions; and forms the basis for extension to include rotational dynamics of the simulator system.</dd>

          <dd>This paper presents a novel multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV, or OmniCopter, has eight rotors: four lift rotors in the typical quadcopter layout and four thrust motors that are orthogonal to the lift rotors and arranged as two pairs of co-axial counter-rotating rotors. The OmniCopter layout allows the decoupling of translation and orientation that is found in traditional multi-rotor UAVs. The OmniCpoter is able to translate in the plane orthogonal to the lift rotors without having to first roll and/or pitch. Testing is undertaken to determine the OmniCopters ability to reject disturbances from gusting winds. The results show that the OmniCopter has better disturbance rejection abilities when compared to the traditional multi-rotor layout.</dd>

          <dd>In today’s era of the Internet of Things, it is crucial to study the real-time dependencies of the web, its failures and time delays. Today, smart grid, sensible homes, wise water networks, intelligent transportation, infrastructure systems that connect our world over fast developing. The shared vision of such systems is typically associated with one single conception internet of things (IoT), where through the employment of sensors, the entire physical infrastructure is firmly fastened with information and communication technologies; where intelligent observation and management is achieved via the usage of networked embedded devices. The performance of a real-time control depends not only on the reliability of the hardware and software used but also on the time delay in estimating the output, because of the effects of computing time delay on the control system performance. For a given fixed sampling interval, the delay and loss issues are the consequences of computing time delay. The delay problem occurs when the computing time delay is nonzero but smaller than the sampling interval, while the loss problem occurs when the computing time delay is greater than, or equal to, the sampling interval, i.e., loss of the control output. These two queries are analysed as a means of evaluating real-time control systems. First, a general analysis of the effects of computing time delay is presented along with necessary conditions for system stability. In this paper, we will focus on the experimental study of the closed loop control system in the Internet of Things to determine the cycle time constraints in case of link failure.</dd>

          <dd>Visual Aids for the blind people is an important subject.  Apparently visually impaired individuals get impeded by certain hurdles in everyday life. This work proposes an indoor navigation system for visually impaired people. In particular, the goal of this study is to develop a robust, independent and portable aid to assist a user to navigate familiar as well as unfamiliar areas.  The algorithm uses the data from Microsoft Xbox Kinect 360 which makes a 3D map of the indoor areas and detects the depth of an obstacle/human. To ensure the accuracy, Kinect tool is enabled with a colour camera to capture real-time details of surroundings which are then processed accordingly. Besides, the developed aid makes the user aware of environment changes through a Bluetooth enabled headphones used as audio output device. The trials were conducted on six blindfolded volunteers who successfully navigated across various locations in the university campus such as classrooms, hallways, and stairs. Moreover, the user could also track a particular person through output generated from processed images. Hence, the work suggests a significant improvement for existing visual aids which may be very helpful in customization as well as the adaptability of these devices.</dd>

          <dt>Abstract</dt>
          <dd>Brushless DC motor torque ripple reduction has been the main issue in servo driving systems in which the speeds of fluctuation, vibration, and acoustic noise should be minimized. Most methods for suppressing torque ripples usually require Fourier series, analysis, finite element analysis or least-mean-square minimization. These methods might lead to errors during complex Fourier series analysis and cost much calculation time. This paper presents a new method to improve torque ripple based on the Genetic Algorithm. The proposed method depends on Genetic Algorithms to search for the Fourier coefficients of three-phase stator currents for the given back-EMF waveforms. These Fourier coefficients can then be used to recompose three-phase optimum current commands for three-phase balanced brushless DC motor driving. The torque ripple must therefore be expected to improve in this way if stator currents are perfectly achieved. The validity and practical applications of the proposed method are verified from experiments using the TMS320F2812 DSP. In the experimental structure the three-phase optimum current commands and the measured three-phase back-EMFs are set up as the tables. They are obtained according to the rotor angle and speed information from the encoder. The experimental results can prove that the proposed method provides a simple and efficient way to obtain three-phase optimum stator currents for the given back-EMF waveforms and the minimum torque ripple will also be acquired.</dd>

          <dd>We reviewed the dynamic modeling of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and proposed a rotor angle position control method with an error constraint for the PMSM. To guarantee the tolerance of the position tracking error, a backstepping controller is proposed using the barrier Lyapunov function. In addition, closed-loop stability of the proposed method is analyzed using the Lyapunov theorem.</dd>

           <dt>Abstract</dt>
          <dd>In this study, real-time performance of open source-based EtherCAT master systems is examined. EtherCAT is widely used in the automation field because of the low system setup cost and excellent performance. There are various commercial products and open source projects because EtherCAT is an open field bus with an international standard. The EtherCAT master stacks are particularly being applied to the existing open source-based real-time linux platforms. In this study, the EtherCAT master stack of IgH, which is the most widely used open source EtherCAT master, was applied to an open source-based real-time linux platform. Then, a comparison experiment   of real-time performance was conducted with the Beckhoff’s TwinCAT, which is the standard of the EtherCAT master system.</dd>
