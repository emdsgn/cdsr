  <p class="body">Dr. Behrad Khamesee is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada. He is the director of MagLev Microrobotics Laboratory and an integral member of the Waterloo Center for Automotive Research (WATCAR) at the University of Waterloo. </p>
  <p class="body">His research interests and expertise include design, modeling, and control of advanced mechatronics systems, particularly microrobotic magnetic levitation and semi-active electromagnetic dampers for vehicles. His research has resulted in 90 refereed Journal and conference papers, and his research group is a recipient of several best paper awards. His research group developed the world’s smallest magnetically-levitated microrobot which is equipped with a gripper. This achievement was featured in several news releases in media such as the Economist magazine (Science and Technology: Look, no wires) April 2009 issue. Dr. Khamesee is involved in conferences program committees, has organized several sessions at international conferences, and is a technical reviewer for several IEEE Journals.</p>

  <p class="body">Naira Hovakimyan received her MS degree in Theoretical Mechanics and Applied Mathematics in 1988 from Yerevan State University in Armenia. She got her Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics in 1992, in Moscow, from the Institute of Applied Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences, majoring in optimal control and differential games. Before joining the faculty of UIUC in 2008, she spent time as a research scientist at Stuttgart University in Germany, at INRIA in France, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and she was on faculty of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering of Virginia Tech from 2003 to 2008. She is currently a W. Grafton and Lillian B. Wilkins Professor of Mechanical Science and Engineering at UIUC. In 2015 she was named inaugural director for Intelligent Robotics Lab of CSL at UIUC. She has co-authored two books, six patents and more than 350 refereed publications. She was the recipient of the <i>SICE International scholarship for the best paper</i> of a young investigator in the VII ISDG Symposium (Japan, 1996), the 2011 recipient of <i>AIAA Mechanics and Control of Flight</i> award,  the 2015 recipient of <i>SWE Achievement Award</i>, and the 2017 recipient of IEEE CSS Award for <i>Technical Excellence in Aerospace Controls</i>. In 2014 she was awarded the <i>Humboldt prize</i> for her lifetime achievements. In 2015 she was awarded the UIUC Engineering Council award for <i>Excellence in Advising</i>. She is a Fellow and life member of AIAA, a Senior Member of IEEE, and a member of SIAM, AMS, SWE, ASME and ISDG. She is cofounder and chief scientist of IntelinAir. Her work in robotics for elderly care was featured in the New York Times, on Fox TV and CNBC. Her research interests are in control and optimization, autonomous systems, neural networks, game theory and their applications in aerospace, robotics, mechanical, agricultural, electrical, petroleum, biomedical engineering and elderly care.</p>
