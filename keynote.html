  <p class="body">Dr. Behrad Khamesee is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada. He is the director of MagLev Microrobotics Laboratory and an integral member of the Waterloo Center for Automotive Research (WATCAR) at the University of Waterloo. </p>
  <p class="body">His research interests and expertise include design, modeling, and control of advanced mechatronics systems, particularly microrobotic magnetic levitation and semi-active electromagnetic dampers for vehicles. His research has resulted in 90 refereed Journal and conference papers, and his research group is a recipient of several best paper awards. His research group developed the world’s smallest magnetically-levitated microrobot which is equipped with a gripper. This achievement was featured in several news releases in media such as the Economist magazine (Science and Technology: Look, no wires) April 2009 issue. Dr. Khamesee is involved in conferences program committees, has organized several sessions at international conferences, and is a technical reviewer for several IEEE Journals.</p>
