  <p class="body">Dr. Timothy Barfoot (Professor, University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies – UTIAS) holds the Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Autonomous Space Robotics and works in the area of guidance, navigation, and control of mobile robots a variety of applications.  He is interested in developing methods to allow mobile robots to operate over long periods of time in large-scale, unstructured, three-dimensional environments, using rich onboard sensing (e.g., cameras and laser rangefinders) and computation.   Dr. Barfoot took up his position at UTIAS in May 2007, after spending four years at MDA Space Missions, where he developed autonomous vehicle navigation technologies for both planetary rovers and terrestrial applications such as underground mining.  He sits on the editorial boards of the International Journal of Robotics Research and the Journal of Field Robotics.  He recently served as the General Chair of Field and Service Robotics (FSR) 2015, which was held in Toronto.  He is the author of a new book, “State Estimation for Robotics”, in press.</p>

  <p class="body">He received his PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada in 1995. He was NSERC postdoctoral fellow and instructor in the Center for Intelligent Machines and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of McGill University (1995-1997). He has also been Visiting Professor in Technical University of Munich (Germany), INRIA-IRISA (France), and KAIST (Korea). His research interests span over optomechatronic systems with the focus on image-guided control of autonomous robotic systems. He currently serves as the Technical Editor of <i>IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics</i>, and on the Editorial Board of several journals including <i>International Journal of Optomechatronics, Journal of Robotics, and The Open Cybernetics and Systemics Journal</i>. He also chairs CSME Technical Committee on Mechatronics and MEMS. He has organized several international conferences including <i>International Symposium on Optomechatronic Technologies, ISOT 2010 (Toronto, Canada) and SPIE International Conference on Optomechatronic Systems Control (2005, 2006)</i>, and served in Program Committees of more than twenty International Conferences. Among the awards he received were several Best Paper Awards, a German Research Foundation (DFG) Guest Professorship Award, INRIA Visiting Professorship Award, and Dean’s one Teaching Award and two Scholarly, Research and Creative Activity Awards at Ryerson University. </p>
